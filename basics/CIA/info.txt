1. confidentiality
confidentiality requires that unauthorized users should not be able to access sensitive resources. Confidentiality must be balanced with availability; authorized persons must still access the resources they have been granted permissions for.
2. Integrity
Data must not change during transit, and unauthorized entities should not alter the data.
3. availability
authorized persons should have access to permitted resources at all times
